# Features

* Storage of earthquake metadata, station metadata, raw ground-motion time histories, processed ground-motion time histories, and provenance information in a single, portable file.

* Import data from local filesystem or fetch data using web services from FDSN data centers.

* Can compute add additional metrics by starting at an intermediate stage.

* Simplify reprocessing of data for efficient evaluation of new or alternative algorithms.

* Raw inputs are earthquake metadata, station metadata and ground-motion time histories directly from seismological sources; only downstream products need to be updated when earthquake or station metadata changes, e.g., revised earthquake location.
