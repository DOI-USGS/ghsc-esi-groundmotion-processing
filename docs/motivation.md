# Motivation

* Facilitate creation of ground-motion data sets for multiple types of analysis.

* Leverage best practices from the community to standardize processing algorithms used in ShakeMap ground-motion processing software.

* Disentangle ground-motion processing (broad range of uses) from specific applications, e.g., ShakeMap generation.


# Objective

The goal of this project is to update, restructure, and consolidate existing USGS ground-motion processing software to
incorporate recent advances from researchers at the USGS, PEER, and others. It will standardize tools for multiple USGS
ground-motion products and enable scientists within the USGS and the external community to develop and expand
ground-motion datasets used in many different applications. Additionally, it will provide a standard interface for local
storage of recorded and synthetic ground-motion waveforms and intensity metrics, as well as event and station metadata,
in one container that can be easily distributed. The resulting open-source software will provide customizable processed
ground-motion waveforms and intensity metrics, while adhering to USGS software standards, including documentation, peer
review, testing, and continuous integration.

# Target Use Cases

* Standardize processing of ground-motion waveform data, including ground-motion simulations, for deriving a wide variety of Intensity Measure Types (IMTs) for real-time and simulation-based scenario ShakeMap production.

* Develop uniformly processed ground-motion data sets leveraging data from a variety of sources for use in development and analysis of ground-motion prediction equations, shaking duration, site response, testing of earthquake early warning algorithms, and testing seismic velocity models.

* Facilitate access to and routine processing of waveform and parametric data from a wide variety of data sources in many different formats, including COSMOS, PEER/NGA, CESMD/VDC, and international strong motion data sets.
