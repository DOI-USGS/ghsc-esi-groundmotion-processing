## User Information

This is one of the shorter sections and simply includes user information. This
information used to populate the SEIS-PROV documents. While this may seem like
a minor issue, knowledge the creator of a dataset is very important if the data
will ever be shared/distributed. 

Example:

```yaml
user:
  name: Test user
  email: test@email.com
```
