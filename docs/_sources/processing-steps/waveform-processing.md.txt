Here we describe the different processing steps and their options. They
can be grouped in the following categories:

* [Initial quality control](waveform-processing/initial-qc.md)

* [Removing instrument response](waveform-processing/remove-response.md)

* [Phase pickers](waveform-processing/phase-pickers.md)

* [Baseline correction](waveform-processing/baseline-correction.md)

* [Filtering](waveform-processing/filtering.md)
