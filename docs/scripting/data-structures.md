# Data Structures

`gmprocess` uses a number of data structures that make reading and processing
significant motion data easier.

* [StationTrace](data-structures/station-trace.md): waveform data and
  metadata for a single channel.
* [StationStream](data-structures/station-stream.md): a collection of
  StationTrace objects. 
* [StreamCollection](data-structures/stream-collection.md): a collection of
  StationStream objects.
