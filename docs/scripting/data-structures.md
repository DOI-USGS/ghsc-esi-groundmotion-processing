# Data Structures

`gmprocess` uses a number of data structures that make reading and processing
significant motion data easier.

* [StationTrace](data-structures/station-trace.html): waveform data and metadata for a single channel.
* [StationStream](data-structures/station-stream.html):
* [StreamCollection](data-structures/stream-collection.html)
