# Tutorials

:::{attention}
The path to the data files for the tutorials is a relative path, and so these tutorial must be run from the base of the repository for the tutorial data to be found, or the paths must be manually adjusted.
:::

We recommend that new users go through these tutorials by copying and pasting the example code in [IPython](https://ipython.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/).
These tools facilitate interactive evaluation of the code.
The examples in these tutorials and the resulting output from the code cells (both text and plots) are evaluated with the latest version of gmprocess when the documentation is built. 
This should ensure that you will get consistent results.
If not, please contact the developers.
