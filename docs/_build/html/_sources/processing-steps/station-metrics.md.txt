# Computing station metrics

Station metrics include parameters like source-to-site distances and  Vs30.
There are many alternative distance measures available, and currently we
only support epicentral and hypocentral distances. In the next release of
this software we will expand the list of station metrics to include:

- Rupture distance
- Joyner-Boore distance
- Strike-Parallel and Strike-Normal Coordinate System
  ([GC2](http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20151028))
- Time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (Vs30) as estimated
  from a map or from a database of site-specific measurements.
