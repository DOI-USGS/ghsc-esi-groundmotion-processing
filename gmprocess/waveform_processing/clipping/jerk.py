    A class to represent the jerk method for clipping detection

    Attributes:
        POINT_THRESH (float):
            Minimum number of flagged points required to label trace
            as clipped.
        st (StationStream):
                Stream of data.

    Methods:
        _detect(tr):
            Determines if the trace is clipped or not.
        get_results():
            Iterates through each trace in each stream of stream_collection to
