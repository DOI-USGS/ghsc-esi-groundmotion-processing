# Introduction
This is a project designed to provide a number of functions related to parsing and processing earthquake ground motion data, building on top of the [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) library.
Most of the extensions that we provide are to handle strong motion data and related issues.


# Documentation
- Please note, we are in the process of improving the documentation and that there are some incomplete sections.
- The full documentation can be viewed locally if you clone this repository and open up `docs/index.html` in a browser.
- We hope to have the documentation hosted on the web soon.
