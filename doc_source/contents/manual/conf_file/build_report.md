## Summary Report

This is for building a report, with a one-page summary of the data in each
StationStream per page. It will write out the latex file, and then look for
the `pdflatex` command and attempt to build the pdf. 

Currently, this section is really just a place holder and has to be exactly as
given below. We anticipate adding new options in the future.

```yaml
build_report:
    format: latex
```
