# Processing Steps

The processing steps that are applied to the waveforms are set in the `processing`
section of the config file, and the structure of this file is described in more
detail [here](config_file.md). 

The processing steps can also be printed to the terminal with the `processing_steps`
subcommand. We also summarize the processing steps here:
