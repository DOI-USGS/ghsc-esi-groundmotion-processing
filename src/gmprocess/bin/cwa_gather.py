    To obtain CWA strong motion data, create an account on the CWA:

    https://gdms.cwa.gov.tw/


    Step 1: CWBSN metadata
    ----------------------

    Click on the "Data" icon, then click on "Instrument Response". 

     - For "Output Format", choose "Station XML".
     - For "Network", choose "CWBSN".
     - For "Station", check "All Stations".
     - For "Location", choose "*" for all locations.
     - For "Channel", choose "HN?" for all strong motion stations.
     - For "Start Time (UTC)", enter a date before the event of interest.
     - For "End Time (UTC)", enter a date after the event of interest.
     - "Label", doesn't matter becasue they don't use what you put here.
     - Click the "Submit" button, and you should see a "Success!" pop up.
     - Next will be a screen showing a list of all of your downloads.
     - Right click on the most recent entry, it will be called "output.stationXML"
     - Select "save link as" and name it <eventid>_cwbsn.xml
     
    Step 2: TSMIP metadata
    ----------------------

    Click on the "Data" icon, then click on "Instrument Response". 

     - For "Output Format", choose "Station XML".
     - For "Network", choose "TSMIP".
     - For "Station", check "All Stations".
     - For "Location", choose "*" for all locations.
     - For "Channel", choose "HL?" for all strong motion stations.
     - For "Start Time (UTC)", enter a date before the event of interest.
     - For "End Time (UTC)", enter a date after the event of interest.
     - "Label", doesn't matter becasue they don't use what you put here.
     - Click the "Submit" button, and you should see a "Success!" pop up.
     - Next will be a screen showing a list of all of your downloads.
     - Right click on the most recent entry, it will be called "output.stationXML"
     - Select "save link as" and name it <eventid>_tsmip.xml

    Step 3: CWBSN ground motions
    ----------------------------

    Click on the "Data" icon, then click on "Multi-Station Waveform Data". 

     - For "Output Format", choose "MiniSEED".
     - For "Network", choose "CWBSN".
     - For "Station", check "All Stations".
     - For "Location", choose "*" for all locations.
     - For "Channel", choose "HN?" for all strong motion stations.
     - For "Start Time (UTC)", enter a time 30 seconds before the origin time of 
       interest.
     - For "End Time (UTC)", enter a time 4 minutes after the origin time of interest.
       Note that this can be adjusted up for larger earthquakes or down for smaller.
     - For "Label" use <eventid>_cwbsn_data
     - Click the "Submit" button, and you should see a "Success!" pop up.
     - Next will be a screen showing a list of all of your downloads. Data links will
       take a few minutes to process.
     - Download the file, which will be named <eventid>_cwbsn_data

    Step 4: TSMIP ground motions
    ----------------------------

    Click on the "Data" icon, then click on "Multi-Station Waveform Data". 

     - For "Output Format", choose "MiniSEED".
     - For "Network", choose "TSMIP".
     - For "Station", check "All Stations".
     - For "Location", choose "*" for all locations.
     - For "Channel", choose "HN?" for all strong motion stations.
     - For "Start Time (UTC)", enter a time 30 seconds before the origin time of 
       interest.
     - For "End Time (UTC)", enter a time 4 minutes after the origin time of interest.
       Note that this can be adjusted up for larger earthquakes or down for smaller.
     - For "Label" use <eventid>_tsmip_data
     - Click the "Submit" button, and you should see a "Success!" pop up.
     - Next will be a screen showing a list of all of your downloads. Data links will
       take a few minutes to process.
     - Download the file, which will be named <eventid>_tsmip_data
     

    You will need to run the cwa_gather command twice, once for each pair of XML and
    tgz files for the CWBSN and TSMIP networks.
